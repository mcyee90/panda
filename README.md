# pandas

In Heroes of PyMoli, I analyzed a fictional dataset surrounding a video game and in-game purchases of items. To analyze the data, I put the data into python using a Jupyter Notebook and used Pandas to display the output. I analyzed various metrics surrounding the data including:
1. Player Count
2. Purchasing Analysis including number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases and total revenue.
3. Demographic and Purchasing Analysis by players. Including Gender Breakdown, Purchase Count, Average Purches by Gender, Total Purchases by Gender and normalized values.
4. Binning by Age for players including purchase count for bin, purchase prices for bin, averages for bin and normalized.
5. Top five biggest spenders by purchases, average purchases and purchase values.
6. Most popular items by ID, Item Name, Purchase Count, Prirce and Value
7. Most profitable items by ID, Name, Count, Price and Value.
